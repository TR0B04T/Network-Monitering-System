# Network-Monitering-System
A packet sniffer network monitoring system is a powerful tool for any network administrator. It allows you to see all of the data that is sent and received on a network, as well as giving you access to the packets themselves. This makes it easy to identify and analyze various kinds of network traffic and identify potential security vulnerabilities. The system can also be used to isolate, monitor, and analyze individual packets, allowing you to discover the source and destination of the traffic. With this visibility, an administrator can detect and respond to cyber threats quickly and effectively. In addition to cyber security, packet sniffers can also be used to troubleshoot network issues, as well as to detect and prevent malicious activity.

## Let's Build

I will need to have a clear understanding of the network's architecture and its components. I will also need to have a good grasp on the various networking protocols and technologies that are used in the network. Once these requirements are met, I can begin setting up the necessary resources to monitor the network.

- First, I will need to set up the monitoring software, such as Nagios or Zabbix. This software will monitor the network and provide alerts whenever any abnormalities are detected. It is important to ensure that the software is configured correctly so that it can collect accurate data and provide reliable alerts.

- Next, I will need to determine which metrics I want to monitor. Common metrics include bandwidth usage, latency, throughput, CPU and memory usage, and others. Once I have chosen the metrics, I can begin setting up the necessary monitoring scripts.

- Finally, I will need to set up a dashboard that makes the monitoring data available to me in real-time. This dashboard can be used to track the network's performance and identify any areas that need improvement.

By following these steps, I will have a comprehensive network monitoring system that can provide me with the information I need to ensure the network is running efficiently and reliably.
