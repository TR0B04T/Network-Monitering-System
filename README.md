# Network-Monitering-System
A packet sniffer network monitoring system is a powerful tool for any network administrator. It allows you to see all of the data that is sent and received on a network, as well as giving you access to the packets themselves. This makes it easy to identify and analyze various kinds of network traffic and identify potential security vulnerabilities. The system can also be used to isolate, monitor, and analyze individual packets, allowing you to discover the source and destination of the traffic. With this visibility, an administrator can detect and respond to cyber threats quickly and effectively. In addition to cyber security, packet sniffers can also be used to troubleshoot network issues, as well as to detect and prevent malicious activity.
